# Naive-Bayes-Classifier
Project from graduate computer science course on Data Mining

This repository contains the code I turned in for the project mentioned above. The workflow goes as follows:
1. crawler.py
2. generate dataframe.py
3. split data into train_test.py
4. CASE 1.py
5. CASE 2.py

In main.py, I combine all the code into one file, as I had to turn it in as a single file.
